## What has changed since the old update? 

So firstly I want to say that I have came a long way. Since then I used to make bots that did not run and function so well, and I thought they was brilliant, I was wrong. I now understand the concept and know how to maintain and catch errors properly. Running this bot will 100% ensure your server is kept together. 

I want to say if you bought the old bot, and lost all of doubt, I suggest you give it one more chance.  There is a reason why all of them bots have been removed off my store. You can for sure get an understanding of what type of developer I am off this bot. 

I have also now introduced some dynamic permissions. This means you can have as many permissions per command as you wish. Instead of my old bots where it would only accept one role, you can now do as many as you want!

I have got more of a flow, having embeds with multiple different styles look bad. All of the embeds now look all the same and together. You can find this buy using any two commands.

You do not need a hosting, but I highly suggest obtaining one. Without one you may not be able to keep your bot online 24/7. If you do not want to keep your bot online for that long then just ignore this message.
